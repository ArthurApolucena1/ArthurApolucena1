I am a Systems Analysis and Development student with a great passion for technology and programming.

My dedication lies in exploring new approaches and tools, constantly seeking to enhance my skills and knowledge. I do this primarily through the creation and execution of practical projects.
I believe in the power of technology to uplift people and am always looking to learn and build systems that generate a positive impact. My goal is to apply the acquired knowledge to develop effective solutions.
